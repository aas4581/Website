                            <p>Vendor Labs LLC was founded with one goal in mind: and that goal is to connect food trucks and street vendors with their customers. Vendor was founded after one of its founders made a trip to New York City and wanted to find the best vendors in town but didn’t know where to look. Shortly after, Vendor was born. As a company, we are striving to revolutionize the street food industry by allowing customers to easily find the perfect street vendor or food truck.</p>

                            <p>We noticed that most vendors had profiles scattered across various social media sites and that finding an accurate location of your favorite vendor, or one serving the food you want was a complicated and almost impossible task. Vendor is looking to streamline and modernize this process by centralizing all the vendors we can on one platform. This way vendors can be sure that their customers can find them easily and it also provides exposure for vendors to new and potential customers</p>
